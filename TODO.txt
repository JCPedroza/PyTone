- Need a function that consumes a sharp note and turns it into a flat note, or
other dynamic to handle enharmonic (C sharp and D flat, for example)

- Use OOP in general, convert everything to objects, but leave the option to work with lists, strings, etc (old and new design combined)

- TESTS_chord_check() needs tests with chord objects

- Other data definition needs a class, like a chord class

- Apply systematic design
